# Cooligans
A 3D version of the classic worms game using the marching cubes algorithm for procedural destructable terrain.  

The project is written primarily in C++, using OpenGL for graphics. It is written using its own engine with OpenGL as a graphics API.  

It is unfinished, but shows a proof of concept for marching cubes to be used in this way.
